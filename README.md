This is a website with pages, links, and other thigns that I finder interesting. 

I'm aiming to be as generic HTML5 as possible with little to no Javascript. I've started using little to no CSS (with the exception of font, which seems hard to get set globally across all browsers without the technique I've employed) with simple elements. This meant to just be a place to store thoughts, links, and other interesting tidbits. 

Things on top of my mind:
* Making it accessible from every single browser. 
* Making it editable from everywhere. 
* Being able to track the full history of the site over time.
