    <h1>Home</h1>
    <p>Welcome.</p>
    
    <p>
        Starting in the summer of 2022, we spent a year sailing the west coast of the United States and Mexico. 
        We've written a bit about our experiences <a href="https://www.sveventide.com/">here</a>, 
        from <a href="https://www.sveventide.com/anchorages">places we've gone</a>, 
        to <a href="https://www.sveventide.com/blog">passages we've done</a>, 
        and <a href="https://www.sveventide.com/eventide-academny">boat school we've worked our way through</a>. 
        Some of the sights and sounds are captured <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sveventide/">here</a>.
        Along the way, we've gathered lots of links to weather resources available <a href="weather.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>I keep a blog of sorts <a href="https://amarcuss.substack.com/">here</a>.</p>
    
    <p>This is a site hosted on <a href="http://www.github.com/">GitHub</a>. It's a pretty great workflow to be able to edit in a browser, or via a rich client in your favorite editor, include strong source control, versioning, and change management.</p>
